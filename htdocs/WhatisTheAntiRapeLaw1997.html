          <h2>Anti Rape Law of 1997: A Brief History</h2>
          <div id="nineteen-thirties">
            <h3>1930s</h3>
            <p>
              The Philippines adopted the Revised Penal Code (RPC) of 1930. Under Chapter 2, Article 335, 
              rape is defined as having sexual intercourse with a woman under the following circumstances: 
              with the use of force of intimidation, when the woman is unconscious or deprived of reason 
              (suffering from mental abnormalities or retardation), or the victim is under 12 years old. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="nineteen-ninties">
            <h3>1990</h3>
            <p>
              Camarines Congressman Raul Roco attempted to amend the definition of rape in the 1930 RPC by 
              changing it to be a crime against persons rather than chastity. Under this amendment, 
              anyone with knowledge about the crime may continue filing the case on the victim’s behalf
              even if the victim drops the case. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="ninety-seven">
            <h3>1997</h3>
            <p>
              Republic Act No. 8353 or the Anti Rape Law of 1997 was approved on September 30, 1997.
              The amendment included rape as a crime against persons and punishments for the crime happening 
              in several circumstances. The law retained the provision on statutory rape only when the victim 
              is below 12 years old and the forgiveness clause which removed legal ties from the crime 
              when the offender and the victim marries. 
            </p>

          <h2>Anti Rape Law of 1997: The Controversial Clauses</h2>
          <div id="definition">
              <h3>
                Article 266-A, 1.: “Rape: When And How Committed. - Rape is committed:
                By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances…”
              </h3>
              <p>
                Under Article 266-A, rape is only qualified when the victim is a woman. This gives unequal protection 
                to men, especially young boys who are statistically more vulnerable to rape in the Philippines. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <div id="statutory">
              <h3>             
                Article 266-A 1(d): “When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, 
                even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.”
              </h3>
              <p>
                Under Article 266-A, a person who is 12 years of age and older is deemed mature enough to give their 
                consent in sexual activities. This makes young people more vulnerable to sexual abuse, teenage pregnancy 
                and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  A study conducted by the University of Rochester Medical Center 
                states that a human brain is not developed until the age of 25. A child under the age of 12 may not fully 
                understand the concept of consent which can lead to their offenders sexually abusing them. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <div id="pardon">
              <h3>
                Article 266-C. Effect of Pardon: “The subsequent valid marriage between the offended party shall 
                extinguish the criminal action or the penalty imposed.”
              </h3>
              <p>
                Under Article 266-C, the offender will not receive legal punishment when the victim agrees to marry their 
                offender or is forgiven by their victim who is also their legal spouse.  This law traps rape victims in 
                more danger as they are more likely to be abused when their offender is free from punishment.
