						<h2 id="text_head">How protected are Filipino children from sexual violence?</h2>
						<p id="explanation">
							According to the National Baseline Study on Violence Against Children in the Philippines,
							approximately 5 million Filipino children have experienced a form of sexual violence. 
							That is 1 out of every 5 children aged 13-17 years old. Moreover, from the 5 million children, 
							more boys were reported to have experienced a form of sexual violence. 
							The study also found out that approximately 4 million Filipino children experienced sexual violence 
							where their family members were the offenders.</p>

						<h2 id="text_head">How is the Anti Rape Law of 1997 harmful for children?</h2>
						<p id="explanation">
							The Anti Rape Law of 1997 states that children above the age of consent are encouraged to 
							testify in court—which can be very traumatic. Moreover, it is scientifically proven that a human mind 
							fully develops emotional maturity at the age of 25, thus hindering children from having sound judgment.
							This hinders them from fully grasping the concept of proper consent which can be easily manipulated by their offenders.
							This, in turn, makes children and teens more vulnerable to rape and other forms of sexual violence.</p>

					<section id="text">
						<h2 id="text_head">Why is passing this revision so important?</h2>
						<p id="explanation">
							The revision gives equal protection for every Filipino child, regardless of gender. 
							At present, when a boy gets raped, the law only considers this as “sexual assault"—which only demands
							a 6 - 12 year sentence in jail. But when a girl gets raped, the law considers this as “rape” and demands 
							20 – 40 years or even life imprisonment. Moreover, this revision also removes the loophole 
							of the offender marrying their victim to erase the crime from their records. This makes the offenders
							be held accountable of their actions instead of erasing any legal ties from their crime.</p>
